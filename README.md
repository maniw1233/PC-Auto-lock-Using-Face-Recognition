# PC-Auto-lock-Using-Face-Recognition

Welcome to **PC-Auto-lock-Using-Face-Recognition**!

Thank you for checking out this project! The primary aim of this project is to ensure that your computer remains secure by locking it instantly if someone who is not recognized or not registered in the system tries to access it. This provides an additional layer of protection, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

## Objective

The objective of the PC Auto Lock Using Face Recognition project is to enhance computer security by implementing an automatic locking mechanism. The system utilizes face recognition technology to identify users and locks the PC when an unauthorized or unregistered face is detected. This approach ensures that only verified users can access the computer, providing a higher level of security and protection against unauthorized access.

---

## Implementation

The feature involves continuously running the webcam until an unregistered face is detected. When an unregistered face is detected, the PC will automatically lock. The project includes an "auto-lock" toggle key that the Admin can turn on or off as needed. When enabled, the webcam continuously runs until the Admin turns off the toggle key or an unregistered face is detected.
