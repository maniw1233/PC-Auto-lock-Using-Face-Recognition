The objective of the PC Auto Lock Using Face Recognition project is to enhance computer security by implementing an automatic locking mechanism. The system utilizes face recognition technology to identify users and locks the PC when an unauthorized or unregistered face is detected. This approach ensures that only verified users can access the computer, providing a higher level of security and protection against unauthorized access.
